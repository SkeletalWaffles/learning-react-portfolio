# Mark Forsyth Example Portfolio - Learning React

This was an example portfolio that I created in ReactJS, following along with the tutorial in the CodeToSuccess program. It taught me a lot of things about ReactJS, website organization, accessing APIs, and so much more. I also got a chance to use SASS instead of just normal CSS, which was a cool oppurtunity.

Even so, I'm not actually using it as a portfolio currently, so all of the companies listed there are not actually companies that I've worked at ;).
